# Full Stack Boilerplate and Guide

Getting React and Node set up with Webpack for the first time is confusing and frustrating. It's difficult to find learning content related to Webpack that isn't a mess. I think there are a lot of bloggers out there that haven't read up on [Webpack v5](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/). We have new cool things now like [Asset Modules](https://webpack.js.org/blog/2020-10-10-webpack-5-release/#asset-modules)! And a lot of other things are deprecated.

I think one of the major frustrations with learning to set up Webpack is that the Webpack and Babel configuration examples are a mess and it's difficult for a beginner to understand what's going on. This project is my best attempt at creating a clean, intuitive boilerplate and avoid that confusing spaghetti code.

Start with `Getting Started` where you'll find instructions on how to get the app running.

* This app works out of the box if you're just looking for a starting point and know what you're doing.

* If you're looking for a guide, I've created a robust and detailed documentation for everything that's going on in this app.
